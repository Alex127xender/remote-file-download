This README provides instructions for using the "Remote File Downloader" script, which allows you to download remote files and save them locally using a simple PHP-based web form.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the remote file downloader:

Setup the Environment:

Before you begin, make sure you have a web server environment with PHP support set up. You can use tools like XAMPP, WAMP, or your preferred web server.

Clone the Repository:

Clone or download this repository to your web server's root directory or any desired location.

Create a Downloads Folder:

Inside the directory where you placed the script, create a folder named downloads. This is where the downloaded files will be stored.

Access the Web Form:

Open a web browser and navigate to the location where you placed the script on your web server. For example, if your server is running locally, the URL might be http://localhost/remote-file-downloader/index.php.

In the input field labeled "Enter Remote File URL," provide the complete URL of the file you want to download. This can be any valid URL pointing to a file hosted on the internet.

Download the File:

Click the "Download" button after entering the remote file URL. The script will attempt to download the file from the provided URL and save it in the downloads folder.

Download Confirmation:

If the file is successfully downloaded and saved, you'll see a confirmation message along with a link to the downloaded file. Click the link to access the downloaded file.
